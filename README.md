Overview:- 
The project involves creating a demand bicycle dashboard that provides a deep dive into the preferences and trends among different age groups and genders. The dashboard is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, offering stakeholders a clear and actionable view of the data.

Key Features:

Interactive Slicers:- Users can easily filter the data by selecting specific age groups or genders, allowing for targeted analysis of bicycle demand within chosen demographics.

Dynamic Filters:- The dashboard includes advanced filtering options that enable users to explore various segments, such as comparing demand between male and female cyclists across different age brackets.

Comprehensive Charts:- Multiple chart types (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs) are employed to visualize data trends, making it easier to identify patterns and insights. For example, the dashboard may show how demand peaks among certain age groups or how preferences differ between genders.

User-Friendly Interface:- The design prioritizes ease of use, with intuitive navigation that guides users through the dashboard, making complex data accessible even to those without a technical background.

Customizable Views:- Users can customize the dashboard layout and choose which data points to focus on, tailoring the analysis to their specific needs.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Data Visualization:- Power BI/Excel (depending on what you used) was utilized for creating dynamic and visually appealing charts and graphs.

Data Manipulation:- Advanced Excel functions or DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI were employed to manipulate and analyze the dataset efficiently.

Interactivity:- Implemented slicers and filters for real-time interaction with the data, enhancing user engagement.

Outcome:

The dashboard provides actionable insights into bicycle demand trends across various demographics. Stakeholders can make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and product development based on the data-driven findings.
The project demonstrates proficiency in using data visualization tools to create meaningful and impactful dashboards, highlighting trends and patterns that are crucial for business strategy.
